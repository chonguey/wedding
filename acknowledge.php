<B>To Larry Shumway &amp; Linda Carlton:</B>
<p>							
	I can't say enough to my parents about their influence in making me the man I am today.<br />
	Mom - for teaching my kindness and the value of creativity; for giving me a sharp eye for design and details and for the ability to think outside of the box. <br />
	Dad - for teaching me about the value of hard work; that anything I put my mind to I could achieve. You taught me about quiet dignity and the value of being a moral, upstanding person. <br />
	You both have imbued me with the qualities I needed to meet and fall in love with the girl of my dreams. 
	Thank you for everything you have done to help me reach this point. 
	Your influence will continue to be a guiding principle for the rest of my life. <B> - Landon</B>
